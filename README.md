# 💵 Dollar to Egyptian Pound 

I want to extend my gratitude to [@AbdelrahmanMaxwell](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanMaxwell) for his amazing repository ["Dollar-to-Egyptian-Pound-exchange-rate"](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanMaxwell/Dollar-to-Egyptian-Pound-exchange-rate). This repository has inspired me greatly.

This program is a currency converter that allows the user to convert US dollars to Egyptian Pounds or vice versa. The conversion rate is obtained from the website currency.me.uk and the result is displayed with the USD value in green and the EGP value in orange. The user can input the desired amount to be converted and choose the conversion type from a drop-down menu. The program also has a "Convert" button to initiate the conversion process and a spinner to indicate that the conversion is in progress. The program is created by Boda Magdy and Ahmed Osama with assistance from ChatGPT and uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract the conversion rate from the website and the Streamlit library for the user interface.
