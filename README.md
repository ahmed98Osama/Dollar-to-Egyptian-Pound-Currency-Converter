# ðŸ’µ Dollar to Egyptian Pound 

This is a currency conversion program using the Streamlit library, which is a framework for building web applications in Python. The program retrieves the current exchange rate of US dollars to Egyptian pounds from the website "currency.me.uk" using the BeautifulSoup library and the requests module. The user can choose the conversion type (either US dollars to Egyptian pounds or Egyptian pounds to US dollars) and the amount they want to convert. 

I want to extend my gratitude to [@AbdelrahmanMaxwell](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanMaxwell) for his amazing repository ["Dollar-to-Egyptian-Pound-exchange-rate"](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanMaxwell/Dollar-to-Egyptian-Pound-exchange-rate). This repository has inspired me greatly.
